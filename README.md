# Custom Sim Racing Wheel

An open-source, DIY sim racing wheel designed mainly for Formula 1 games, built to explore embedded systems, control electronics, and real-time telemetry integration.

## Planned Features
- USB HID controller via Raspberry Pi Pico
- Push buttons, potentiometers, rotary encoders, paddle shifters and clutch
- LCD display for telemetry (RPM, gear, DRS, lap times)
- Audio alarms for gear shift and settings change
- Designed for use with F1 2025, ACC and more

## Work in Progress
- [X] read digital & analog signals from buttons, switches, encoders
- [X] USB HID mapping, sending controller inputs to PC
- [ ] telemetry display and software
- [ ] enclosure CAD design compatible with MOZA QR system
- [ ] full assembly

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- LCD IPS 2,8" IPS 320x240px display
- push buttons
- rotary switches
- rotary encoders
- carbon wheel case with MOZA QR
